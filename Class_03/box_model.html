                In the 2004–05 season Messi, then 17, became the youngest official player and goal scorer in the Spanish
                La Liga (the country’s highest division of football). Though only 5 feet 7 inches (1.7 meters) tall and
                weighing 148 pounds (67 kg), he was strong, well-balanced, and versatile on the field. Naturally
                left-footed, quick, and precise in control of the ball, Messi was a keen pass distributor and could
                readily thread his way through packed defenses. In 2005 he was granted Spanish citizenship, an honor
                greeted with mixed feelings by the fiercely Catalan supporters of Barcelona. The next year Messi and
                Barcelona won the Champions League (the European club championship) title.
